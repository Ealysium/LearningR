# Welcome to a SESYNC Training Event

Once you have cloned this repository, why don't you push it back up to your own GitHub repo?

First create an empty repo (don't check the README box) for your version of this repository. Then, change the remote url of this repo to point to your GitHub origin. From a shell with working directory set to your local clone, enter:

    git remote set-url https://github.com/%user%/%repo%.git
	
Replace `%user%` with your user name on GitHub and `%repo%` with the name of your new (and empty!) repo.
